# Search In Sorted Matrix

Given a matrix (a two-dimensional array), whose width and height do not
necessarily match, containing distinct integers where each row is sorted and
each column is also sorted, write a function that searches for a target value in
the matrix. The function should return a tuple (or two-element array) of the row
and column indices of the target value. If the target value is not found in the
array, the function should return [-1, -1].

Sample input:
45, </br>
[ </br>
    [1, 4, 7, 12, 15, 999], </br>
    [2, 5, 19, 32, 35, 1001], </br>
    [4, 8, 24, 34, 36, 1002], </br>
    [40, 41, 42, 44, 45, 1003], </br>
    [98, 99, 101, 104, 190, 1009], </br>
]

Expected output: [3, 4]
