# Zeros to the Right

Write a function that takes an array of integers and moves each non-zero
integer to the left side of the array, then returns the number of
non-zero integers. The order of the non-zero integers does not matter in
the mutated array.

## Examples
```
Sample input: [0, 3, 1, 0, -2]
Expected output: 3
Expected output array state: [3, 1, -2, 0, 0]
```

```
Sample input: [4, 2, 1, 5]
Expected output: 4
Expected output array state: [4, 2, 1, 5]
```
